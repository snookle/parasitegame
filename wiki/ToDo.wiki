Selection of To Dos.  Probably best to keep this page to stuff that has to be done within the next week or so

= 'Blob' Prototype ([http://tenfiftyfour.com/akAGames/design/Blob%20Prototypes/Blob%20Dump/BlobTest15.swf Latest Iteration])=
 ===Extra Sliders===
 * ~~Slider for Particle Size~~
 ===Friction and Gravity===
 * Will Implement according to nehe.  We'll see how that goes.
 ===Skin===
{{{
if(has neighbours){
  if(max neighbours){
    highlight(green);
  } else {
    highlight(grey);
  }
} else {
  highlight(red);
}
}}}

 * Any particles that have less than the max neighbours are considered to be on the "outside" of the blob.
  * STEP 1 : Determine which particles are on the inside, and which are on the outside 
   * In Demo Program, Change colour of those particles with all points full
  * STEP 2 : Determine particle dense point ( ie 'centre' ) or perpendicular angle ( to know which direction the 'outside' is
  * STEP 3 : Place a series of 'perimeter springs' around the circumference of the blob
  * STEP 4 : Use Drawing Tools to draw skin, using Perimeter springs as guide points
 * Drawing of exterior blob surface
 ===Inner Particle Ignoring===
 * Perhaps particles that already have the max number of neighbours should ignore all other particles, and only check if their neighbours are too far away.
 ===Centre of Gravity ( ie, to form 'ball' )===
 * Experiment with this anyway, we'll see how it works.  Last on the 'to do' list imo

= Parasite Prototype ([http://tenfiftyfour.com/akAGames/design/Movement%20Prototypes/Flash_IKParasite3.swf Latest Iteration])=
 ===Stiffness===
 * 'locking' the angles in place
  * Have to figure out way to get the current angle, and tell IK to stay at that angle
  * From there, have to unlock dynamic IK Lengths
 ===Springing===
 * Simple Parabolic Motion, Power Determined by current width / original width
