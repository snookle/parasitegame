Selection of work to be done.

= 'Blob' Prototype =
 ===Optomisation===
 * Increase Drawing Speed by Generating Texture during Update, removing loop from draw.
 ===Additions===
 * ~~Spatial Grid~~
 ===Modification of Particle Behaviour===
 * ~~Viscoelastic~~
 ===Skin===
 * ~~Prototype Skin~~
 ===Centre of Gravity ( ie, to form 'ball' )===
 * Experiment with this anyway, we'll see how it works.
 ===Physics===
 * Rigid Bodies
 * Improved Collisions
 ===Environmental===
 * Scrolling/Rotating Screen
  * Camera

= Parasite Prototype =
 ===Stiffness===
 * ~~'locking' the angles in place~~
 * ~~Have to figure out way to get the current angle, and tell IK to stay at that angle~~
 * ~~From there, have to unlock dynamic IK Lengths~~
 ===Springing===
 * ~~Simple Parabolic Motion, Power Determined by current width / original width~~
 * Springing Facing the Correct Direction
 ===Movement===
 * Worm/Caterpillar Movement Trial.
 * Interaction with Physics Objects
  * Walking up/down Surfaces
  * Climbing Specific Wall Types
  * Sticking into Roof with Tail
 ===Mucus===
 * Test Mucus System
