Selection of To Dos.  Probably best to keep this page to stuff that has to be done within the next week or so

= 'Blob' Prototype ([http://tenfiftyfour.com/akAGames/design/Blob%20Prototypes/Blob%20Dump/BlobTest15.swf Latest Iteration])=
 ==Friction and Gravity==
 ==Skin==
 * Any particles that have less than the max neighbours are considered to be on the "outside" of the blob.
 * Drawing of exterior blob surface
 ==Inner Particle Ignoring==
 * Perhaps particles that already have the max number of neighbours should ignore all other particles, and only check if their neighbours are too far away.
 ==Centre of Gravity ( ie, to form 'ball' )==

= Parasite Prototype ([http://tenfiftyfour.com/akAGames/design/Movement%20Prototypes/Flash_IKParasite3.swf Latest Iteration])=
 ==Stiffness==
 * 'locking' the angles in place
  * Have to figure out way to get the current angle, and tell IK to stay at that angle
  * From there, have to unlock dynamic IK Lengths
 ==Springing==
 * Simple Parabolic Motion, Power Determined by current width / original width
