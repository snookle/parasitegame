Still some things unknown : 
 * r^ij
  * We know it's a unit Vector.  But how to calculate it, and what it signifies is still not 100% Sure.  
  * We read that a unit vector is equal to the vector / the normalised vector.  I think I might have a normalising function coded into my Vector2D Class.  Will attempt with that value tomorrow.
  * Normalising Function is as follows : 
{{{
     public function normalize():void
     {
       var length:Number = length();
       if (length == 0)
       {
         return;
       }
       x /= length;
       y /= length;
     }
    }}}
  * Ok, I don't think that's right.  I asked my friend :

`"You calculate the 2-norm (pythagoras' theorem) and divide the whole vector by it`

`so if you had the vector (3,4), you'd have the length being sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = 5`

`so scaling it would give you (0.6, 0.8)"`

[10:02] Sam Clifford: the scalar vector product
[10:03] Sam Clifford: say you have two vectors a and b
[10:03] Sam Clifford: a . b means that you add up a(1)*b(1) + a(2)*b(2) ...
[10:03] Sam Clifford: for however long a and b are
