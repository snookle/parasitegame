= Introduction =

Work in Progress.  Repos. for movement discussions, more details in the [http://code.google.com/p/parasitegame/wiki/DesignDocument Design Document]

= Ideas =

== Basic Movemnt ==

 * Left/Right Motion is Keyboard Controlled
 * Can Crawl only on certain surfaces
  * Surfaces can move up on to ceilings allowing for roof-crawling
 * Can Swim only in certain surfaces
  * Liquids can be stationary or 'stream' like
  * Can ride on 'jets' on other liquids (ie, bloodpump)

== Tail Movement ==

`Discussion 6th July, 10:18am : `
{{{
Ben 
"mouse movements should control the tail without clicking, but actions (cut etc) require a click and drag sort of thing
ah yeah
that's a good idea as well"

Anthony 
"yeah or maybe based on distance"

Ben 
"something we'll prototype"

Anthony 
"so if the mouse is within x pixels of the parasite tail, then it moves to the mouse position"

Ben 
"oh, that's a good idea"

Anthony 
"You can then click on it to make sure it stays in focus".

== Complex Movement ==

 * Inlcuding :
  * Springing
  * Cutting
  * Injecting
  * Digging
  * Hitting
