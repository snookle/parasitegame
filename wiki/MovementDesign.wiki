`Discussion 6th July, 10:18am : `
{{{
Ben 
"mouse movements should control the tail without clicking, but actions (cut etc) require a click and drag sort of thing
ah yeah
that's a good idea as well"

Anthony 
"yeah or maybe based on distance"

Ben 
"something we'll prototype"

Anthony 
"so if the mouse is within x pixels of the parasite tail, then it moves to the mouse position"

Ben 
"oh, that's a good idea"

Anthony 
"You can then click on it to make sure it stays in focus".
