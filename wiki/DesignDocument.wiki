= Introduction =

Introduction goes here.  Include Title, Genre, Direction, Setting, Direction, Edge and Platform.  Sell Concept in One Sentence.  Keep Short.

= Basic Concept / Description =
Basic Concept.  Few Paragraphs / Page.  Describe game to readers as if they are players ( ie. you ).  Narrative of Game Experience.  Avoid mentioning GUI Specifics

= Key Features =
Key Game Features.  List of items which separates game from the pack. Summary of features alluded to in description.

= Schedule and Milestones = 
* July 3 - July 14th : Movement Prototypes
* July 14 - July 30 : Fluid and Liquid Prototypes
* August 1 - August 10 : Enemy and Collectable Prototypes
* *Milestone 1* - August 15 : Attempt to have the entire concept and Idea worked out, complete with working prototypes of each individual section and item.  Allowing for development to commence, and giving us two months to collate everything together ( which, really, is plenty ! )
* August - October : Working on Gamez
* *Milestone 2* - September 1 : Attempt to have a simple working prototype completed
* October 1 : Completed Game
November 1 : Submit Deadline

= Genre =
`Comment By Anthony : Not 100% set on a genre.  Two Possibilities.  A Series of 'levels' ALA 'Lemmings', or a Series of side-scrolling levels ala 'GISH'.  Really depends if we want one localised screen, or a larger 'location'.  Larger location means more complication, I think we might try and keep it to smaller spaces, with the possibility of a scrolling area.  But no a 'platformer' style location`

= Platform = 
Minimum requirements: Windows XP/Vista, .Net runtime, XNA runtime. Video card capable of pixel shader 1.1

= Detailed Concept =
* The Character : Parasite Assassin
* The Goals
** Parasite Assassin hired to kill a single person ? Entire game spent inside a single body ?
** Parasite Assassin hired to kill multiple people ? Game spent in a series of bodies ( including external sequences getting from one body to another ).
** Parasite Assassin hired to kill multiple people ? Game spent in a series of bodies, not all are targets, some are needed to get from one body to another ( use as a host, then transfer to new body ).
